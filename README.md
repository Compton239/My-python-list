HTML5 and Python Learning Repository
Overview
This repository contains two assignments demonstrating fundamental web development and Python programming skills. The first project is an HTML5-based webpage showcasing structured content and form creation with native validation. The second project is a Python script performing basic list operations. Both assignments focus on clean, maintainable code and adherence to best practices without relying on external frameworks or libraries.
Projects
1. Enhanced HTML5 Content & Form

File: enhanced-form.html
Description: A single HTML file that demonstrates the use of HTML5 features, including:
Semantic elements (header, nav, main, section, footer) for accessibility and structure.
Organized content with lists (ordered and unordered) and a table to display course information.
Embedded media (image and video) with descriptive captions.
A fully functional form with various input types (text, email, tel, date, select, textarea), using HTML5 validation attributes (required, minlength, pattern, min) and accessibility features (fieldset, legend, label).
No CSS or JavaScript, relying solely on native HTML5 capabilities.


Usage:
Open enhanced-form.html in a modern web browser.
Explore the content sections and interact with the form to test validation.


Notes:
The form's action attribute is a placeholder (/submit). Update it for server-side processing if needed.
Media elements use external placeholder URLs. Replace with actual files for production use.
The novalidate attribute is included to allow testing, but validation attributes are fully implemented.



2. Python List Operations

File: list_operations.py
Description: A Python script that performs basic list manipulations, including:
Creating an empty list.
Appending values (10, 20, 30, 40).
Inserting a value (15) at the second position.
Extending the list with another list ([50, 60, 70]).
Removing the last element.
Sorting the list in ascending order.
Finding and printing the index of the value 30.


Output:2
[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]


Usage:
Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
Run the script using: python list_operations.py.
Verify the output in the console.



File Structure

enhanced-form.html: HTML5 webpage with content and form.
list_operations.py: Python script for list operations.
README.md: This file, describing the repository.

Setup

HTML Project: No setup required. Open enhanced-form.html in a browser.
Python Project: Requires Python 3.x. Run list_operations.py in a terminal or Python environment.
Dependencies: None. Both projects use native HTML5 and standard Python without external libraries.

Notes

The repository is designed for educational purposes, focusing on HTML5 and Python fundamentals.
The HTML form uses external media URLs for demonstration. Replace with local files if needed.
The Python script is simple and self-contained, suitable for learning basic list operations.
